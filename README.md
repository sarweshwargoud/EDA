📊 Steps Performed in EDA

Loaded the Titanic dataset

Checked dataset structure & summary statistics

Visualized distributions using histograms

Detected outliers using boxplots

Analyzed correlations using heatmap

Explored relationships using pairplots

Studied categorical patterns (Sex, Pclass, Survived)

Identified trends and insights

🔍 Brief Findings

Females had a higher survival rate than males

1st class passengers survived more than 2nd and 3rd class

Fare distribution is right-skewed, with multiple outliers

Children had better chances of survival than adults

Fare and Pclass show meaningful correlation with survival

Age column contains missing values
